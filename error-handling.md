# Error Handling and Edge Case Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for handling errors and addressing edge case scenarios within the application to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience.

## Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy

### Error Categories

We will categorize errors to implement targeted handling mechanisms:

*   **Frontend Errors:** Errors occurring within the user interface, including JavaScript errors, rendering issues, and client-side network problems.
*   **Backend Errors:** Errors originating from the server-side, such as API errors (validation, authentication, server-side logic), database errors, and issues with external service integrations.
*   **Network Errors:** Problems with connectivity between the client and server or between backend services and external APIs.

### Frontend Error Handling

*   **Error Boundaries:** Utilize the `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display UI rendering errors gracefully, preventing the entire application from crashing.
*   **Component-Level Handling:** Implement `try...catch` blocks or promises' `.catch()` methods within components for specific asynchronous operations (e.g., data fetching, form submissions) to handle potential errors at a granular level.
*   **User Feedback:** Provide clear, concise, and actionable feedback to the user when an error occurs. This may include:
    *   In-line error messages for form validation.
 *   **Examples:** "Invalid email address format.", "Password must be at least 8 characters long.", "This field is required."
    *   **Appearance:** Text displayed directly below or next to the input field, often in a distinct color (e.g., red).
    *   Toast notifications or snack bars for transient errors (e.g., momentary network loss).
 *   **Examples:** "Connection lost. Please check your network.", "Failed to save changes. Please try again."
 *   **Appearance:** Brief, non-intrusive messages that appear temporarily.
    *   Full-screen error messages for critical errors (e.g., failure to load a page).
 *   **Examples:** "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try reloading the page.", "Failed to load necessary data."
 *   **Appearance:** Prominent messages that take over the main content area, potentially with an illustration or a retry button.
    *   Visual indicators (e.g., red borders on input fields, error icons) to highlight erroneous areas.
*   **Logging:** Implement client-side error logging to report uncaught errors and handled errors to a logging service for monitoring and debugging.
 *   **Details:** Consider using a service like Sentry or LogRocket. Logs should include error message, stack trace, user ID (if authenticated), and relevant browser/device information.
    *   **Where to Log:** Log unhandled errors in `ErrorBoundary` and specific handled errors within component `catch` blocks.

### Backend Error Handling

*   **Consistent API Error Responses:** Define a standardized JSON format for API error responses. This format should include:
    *   An `errorCode` (a specific code representing the type of error).
    *   A `message` (a human-readable description of the error).
    *   Optional `details` (additional information, e.g., validation errors for specific fields, or related entity IDs).
 *   **Example Format:**


*   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive server-side logging to record all errors, including request details, error messages, and stack traces, for debugging and analysis.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring tools and alerts to proactively identify and respond to critical backend errors in production.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Design backend services with resilience in mind. If an external service fails, the application should ideally degrade gracefully rather than completely failing the user's request (where possible and appropriate).

### Network Error Handling

*   **Connectivity Status:** Integrate with the `ConnectivityStatus` component to display clear visual feedback to the user when the application is offline or experiencing network issues.
*   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement automatic retry logic for idempotent API requests that might fail due to transient network problems.
*   **Offline Behavior:** Define the application's behavior when offline. For critical operations, inform the user they are offline. For non-critical actions, consider queuing them to be synced when connectivity is restored (if applicable to the feature).

## Specific Edge Case Scenarios

This section lists identified edge case scenarios and defines their expected behavior within the application.

*   **Empty States:**
    *   **Scenario:** A list (e.g., Inbox, Booking History, Search Results, Provider's services) has no items to display.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Display a clear and user-friendly message indicating that there is no content, potentially with an illustration or suggestion for the user's next action (e.g., "No messages yet," "Book your first appointment," "Try a different search").
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** Fetching data for a list results in an empty array or a response indicating no items.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:** A dedicated "empty state" component will be used, typically centered in the list area. It will contain a heading with the message, a relevant illustration (optional, but recommended for key screens), and potentially a button or link for a suggested next action.
    *   **Backend Handling (if applicable):** The backend should return an empty array or a clear indicator (e.g., count = 0) when there are no results.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** The user can perform the suggested action (e.g., send a message, create a booking, modify search filters) to populate the list.
*   **Loading States:**
    *   **Scenario:** Data is being fetched from the backend, or an action is being processed.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Display a visual indicator to inform the user that the application is busy. This could be a loading spinner, a skeleton screen (a simplified version of the UI structure), or a progress bar, depending on the context and duration of the operation.
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** Initiating an asynchronous operation (e.g., API call, heavy computation).
    *   **Specific UI/UX:**
        *   For full-screen loads or initial data fetching: Use a skeleton screen that mimics the structure of the content being loaded.
        *   For smaller components or button clicks: Use a loading spinner.
        *   For operations with predictable duration: Use a progress bar.
    *   **Backend Handling (if applicable):** The backend should respond within reasonable timeframes, but the frontend should handle potential delays.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** The loading state resolves automatically when the operation completes successfully or fails (triggering an error state).
*   **Invalid User Input:**
    *   **Scenario:** A user enters data into a form that does not meet the validation requirements (e.g., invalid email format, missing required field).
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Provide immediate and specific feedback to the user, highlighting the problematic input field and displaying a clear error message explaining the validation rule that was violated.
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** User attempts to submit a form, or in some cases, as the user types (real-time validation).
    *   **Specific UI/UX:**
        *   Input fields with validation errors will have a red border or outline.
        *   In-line error messages will appear directly below the problematic input field.
        *   Form submission may be disabled until all required fields are valid.
    *   **Backend Handling (if applicable):** Backend should re-validate input on submission and return detailed validation errors in the API response (`details` field in the error response format).
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** The user must correct the invalid input according to the error messages to proceed.
*   **Permissions and Authorization:**
    *   **Scenario:** A user attempts to access data or perform an action they do not have permission for (e.g., a Looker trying to access Provider-only features, a user trying to view another user's private data).
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Prevent the unauthorized action. Display an appropriate error message (e.g., "You do not have permission to access this content") or redirect the user to a relevant page (e.g., a login page or a restricted access page).
    *   **Triggering Conditions:**
        *   Attempting to navigate to a restricted route.
        *   Attempting to perform an action via an API call that requires higher permissions.
        *   Attempting to view data belonging to another user without proper authorization.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:**
        *   For route restrictions: Redirect to a login page or a dedicated "Access Denied" screen with an explanation.
        *   For action restrictions: Display a toast notification or a modal with the error message.
        *   For data restrictions: Hide or disable the relevant UI elements, or display a message indicating the content is unavailable.
    *   **Backend Handling:** Backend APIs must strictly enforce authorization checks for all requests. Unauthorized requests should return a 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized status code with a clear error message.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** The user may need to log in as a different user with the necessary permissions, or the requested action might be inherently restricted for their role.
*   **Concurrency Conflicts:**
    *   **Scenario:** Two users or devices attempt to modify the same data simultaneously, potentially leading to data inconsistencies.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Implement a strategy to handle these conflicts, such as "last write wins," optimistic concurrency control (notifying the user of a conflict and allowing them to resolve it), or pessimistic locking (preventing simultaneous access). The chosen approach should be documented for each relevant data model or operation.
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** Multiple simultaneous write operations to the same data record.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:**
        *   **Last Write Wins:** The UI might not explicitly show a conflict, and the last submitted change overwrites others. This should be used with caution and only for less critical data.
        *   **Optimistic Concurrency:** If a conflict is detected on the backend, the frontend receives an error. The UI should inform the user that their changes could not be saved because the data has been updated by someone else and offer options (e.g., discard changes and refresh, attempt to merge changes - if feasible).
        *   **Pessimistic Locking:** The UI would indicate that the data is currently being edited by another user, preventing the current user from making changes until the lock is released.
    *   **Backend Handling:** Implement versioning or timestamps on data records to detect conflicts. Define the conflict resolution logic on the backend.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** Depends on the chosen strategy (automatic overwrite, user resolution, waiting for lock release).
*   **External Service Failures:**
    *   **Scenario:** An external service that the backend relies on (e.g., Stripe, a social media API) is unavailable or returns an error.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Handle the error gracefully in the backend. Log the error for investigation. For user-facing operations, inform the user that the specific functionality is temporarily unavailable and suggest retrying later.
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** An API call to an external service fails or times out.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:** Display a user-friendly error message related to the specific functionality (e.g., "Payment processing is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."). Disable or hide features that depend on the failed service.
    *   **Backend Handling:** Implement circuit breakers or timeouts to prevent cascading failures. Log detailed information about the external service error. Return a clear error response to the frontend.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** The user can retry the operation later. The issue typically needs to be resolved by the external service provider or the backend team.
*   **Data Synchronization Conflicts (if offline features are implemented):**
    *   **Scenario:** A user modifies data while offline, and upon reconnecting, the locally modified data conflicts with changes made on the server.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Implement a conflict resolution strategy. This could involve automatically merging changes, prompting the user to choose which version to keep, or flagging the conflict for later resolution.
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** User makes changes offline, and when syncing online, the same data has been modified on the server by another user or device.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:** If automatic merging is not possible or desirable, the UI should present the user with the conflicting versions of the data and allow them to choose which version to keep or how to merge the changes.
    *   **Backend Handling:** Implement logic to detect conflicts during synchronization and apply the chosen resolution strategy.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** User intervention may be required to resolve conflicts.
*   **Large Data Sets:**
    *   **Scenario:** A list or view needs to display a large number of items (e.g., a Provider's extensive booking history, a large list of search results).
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to load and display data in smaller chunks, improving performance and user experience. Avoid loading all data at once.
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** Querying a dataset that is expected to contain a large number of records.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:**
        *   **Pagination:** Display a limited number of items per page with navigation controls (previous/next page buttons).
        *   **Infinite Scrolling:** Load more items automatically as the user scrolls down the list. Display a loading indicator at the bottom while fetching more data.
    *   **Backend Handling:** Backend APIs should support pagination or cursor-based retrieval to return data in manageable chunks based on query parameters (e.g., `limit`, `offset`, `pageToken`).
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** N/A (This is a performance and UX consideration, not a direct error state).
*   **Long Running Operations:**
    *   **Scenario:** An operation takes a significant amount of time to complete (e.g., processing a large image upload, generating a complex report).
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Provide feedback to the user about the operation's progress. This could involve a progress bar, a status message, or performing the operation in the background and notifying the user upon completion (e.g., via push notification).
    *   **Triggering Conditions:** Initiating an operation that involves significant processing time on the backend.
    *   **Specific UI/UX:**
        *   Display a progress indicator (progress bar or spinner) with a clear status message.
        *   Prevent the user from closing the application or navigating away if the operation is critical and must complete.
        *   For background operations, display a non-blocking notification (e.g., toast, push notification) when the operation is complete or encounters an error.
    *   **Backend Handling:** Backend should handle long-running tasks asynchronously (e.g., using background jobs or queues). Provide endpoints to check the status of ongoing operations.
    *   **Recovery/Resolution:** The user waits for the operation to complete. If it fails, an error message should be displayed, and the user might be able to retry.
