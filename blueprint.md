### User Flow: Authorize & Capture Payment Model

This section outlines the definitive user flow for booking and payment using the "Authorize & Capture" model.

1.  **Part 1: The Looker Initiates the Request:** Looker finds a Provider, selects a service, date, and time, then taps "Request to Book." Status becomes "Pending Provider Confirmation."
2.  **Part 2: The Provider Responds:** Provider receives the request, checks schedule, and taps "Confirm Booking."
3.  **Part 3: The Looker Secures the Reservation:**
    - Receives push notification about confirmation and prompt to add payment method.
    - Booking status updates to "Awaiting Reservation" with a [ Reserve with Card ] button.
    - Taps the button and is taken to the **CardAuthorizationScreen**.
    - Enters card details into the secure Stripe form and taps "Reserve My Spot."
    - Stripe verifies the card and places a ‚Ç¨0 authorization hold. Booking status for both users updates to "Confirmed." Screen shows "Your appointment is reserved!" success message.
4.  **Part 4: Post-Appointment, Final Payment & Tipping:**
    - Provider marks the service as "Complete."
    - Looker receives a push notification to finalize payment and add a tip.
    - Looker opens the **FinalizePaymentScreen**.
    - Reviews booking summary, adds an optional tip (using predefined percentages or a custom amount).
    - Reviews the live-updating total amount and payment method.
    - Taps the dynamic [ Pay ‚Ç¨[Total Amount] & Leave Review ] button.
    - System instructs Stripe to "capture" the final amount from the authorized card.
    - Upon successful payment, the Looker is navigated directly to the ReviewForm.

This flow provides a frictionless "book now, pay later" experience for Lookers and guarantees a payment method on file for Providers.

- Components for managing reviews.

*   Troubleshooting and resolving various configuration and syntax errors in both frontend and backend.

## Items Requiring Refinement

*   **Firestore Security Rules:** The current rules are a starting point and need to be refined based on detailed access control requirements (`/home/user/beauty-book-v2/firestore.rules.md`). This includes defining precise read/write conditions for each collection and potentially implementing role-based access control.
*   **Cloud Functions Logic:** The implemented functions (`registerUser`, `loginUser`, `createUser`, `getUser`) contain basic logic, but they might need further refinement based on your specific data models, error handling requirements (`/home/user/beauty-book-v2/error-handling.md`), and security best practices (e.g., input validation, data sanitization).
*   **Frontend Atomic Component Styling and Accessibility:** The `Button` and `InputField` components have basic structure. They need to be styled according to your visual design principles (`/home/user/beauty-book-v2/styling.md`) and enhanced with accessibility features (`/home/user/beauty-book-v2/accessibility.md`).
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** While we've included basic error handling in the functions, a more comprehensive error handling strategy throughout the application (frontend and backend) based on `/home/user/beauty-book-v2/error-handling.md` is needed.
*   **Input Validation:** Robust input validation is needed in both the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity and security.
*   **Frontend State Management:** As the application grows, a state management solution will be needed to manage application-wide state (e.g., user authentication status, user profile data, booking information).
*   **Integration of Frontend and Backend:** Connecting the frontend components to the deployed backend functions is a major upcoming task.
